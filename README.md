# filler

# Description
Create your player to face other students on the famous (or not) plateau of the Filler. The principle is simple: two players compete on a board, and must place, in turn, the piece that the master of the game (provided in the form of a Ruby executable) gives them, thus earning points. The game stops as soon as a piece can no longer be placed. Little fun project!
